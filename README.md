# Plitz7 React Boiler plate

I created this boiler plate as a free preview of the files I will be sharing on my subscription at https://behance.net/normanpleitez7.
The other reason why I'm sharing this boilerplate is to give you an idea of how I'm planning to go over the creation of a new website using my CMS and starting with an Adobe XD Design.

My new CMS is called the david, and you can find more info about it at https://plitz7.com/plitz-website-content-management-system
